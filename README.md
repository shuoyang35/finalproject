# finalproject
Our final project spoke about the relationship between employment rate and internet usage, and whether it differs depending on the status of developed or under-developed countries. We used the packages we were given in class (tidyverse) to develop the graphs and data sets. We found there to be a negative correlation between non-internet usage and employment rates (positive correlation if it was internet usage and employment rates. However, in third-world countries, there seems to be no correlation. Since the majority of the countries are still developing, this would skew the data toward no correlation between the 2 datasets. This answered 2/3 of the research questions 

For the current data, we were able to merge and interpret the datasets while cutting out unnecessary NAs or rows and columns. Each row represents the country's data throughout the years, the left-most column was for countries while the rest of the columns were years. Each of the cells was represented as percentages, columns with year.x were non-internet usage, while columns were with year.y were employment rate. We used line plots to represent the data and used selected countries to represent the status of 'first-world countries' and 'third-world' countries. We also used a scatterplot for internet non-usage and employment rates to see any correlations (if any).
